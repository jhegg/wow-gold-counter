# wow-gold-counter

A World of Warcraft addon that counts up your gold across all of your
characters. It requires a LibDataBroker addon to display the results, for
example Bazooka, Titan Panel, etc. The addon is designed to be very simple,
so it does not have features such as historical tracking.

If you do not have a LibDataBroker addon, then you can try using the slash
command: `/goldcounter`

Note that you have to log in to each character in order to get their current
gold total.
