# GoldCounter

A World of Warcraft addon that counts up your gold across all of your
characters that are on the same realm and faction.

## What does it do?

GoldCounter records the amount of gold that each of your characters have
when you log into them, and keeps that count updated as you earn and spend
gold. It was designed to be very simple, so it does not have features
such as historical tracking, it only shows you the total gold for your
current realm and faction, and it ignores silver and copper.

## How do I use it?

Log into each of your characters that you wish to track.

If you have a LibDataBroker-enabled addon such as TitanPanel or Bazooka, an
icon along with your total gold should show up on the panel/bar. You can also
mouseover the icon to display the per-character breakdown of gold.

If you don't have a LibDataBroker addon, the slash command to print out the
current total gold in the chat window: `/goldcounter` .

## I created this addon because:

* I wanted to see a comma-separated total for my gold across all of my
characters on Alleria's Horde faction.
* I didn't want an addon that had lots of features, since I already have at
least two others installed that do historical tracking, and show total gold
across factions and realms.
* I wanted the total to be displayed at all times on my Bazooka bar. I got
tired of opening up Bagnon and mousing over to see it, or using Broker_Currency
where I also had to mouseover to see it.
